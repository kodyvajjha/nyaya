## 2026-07-09: Two real bugs found and fixed on Vector.pmap_attach — one OOM, one non-termination

**Status: this is a real fix for a real declaration, and likely a major
contributor to the OOM wall described in the entry below (same day, earlier).
Not yet re-run against the full sweep to confirm the wall itself is gone —
see "Next" at the end.**

Investigating a soft failure where `Vector.pmap_attach` OOM-killed the process
under `NYAYA_ONLY_DECL`, two independent, stacked bugs were found by
instrumenting call counts and GC stats and running under `ulimit -v` to get a
fast, repeatable crash instead of eating all system memory.

### Debugging workflow (reusable recipe for the next OOM/hang-shaped bug)

The two bugs below were found without ever letting the process actually
exhaust system memory — that's slow (minutes) and destabilizes the whole
machine each time. Instead:

**1. Get the exact `NYAYA_ONLY_DECL` name first.** It matches the full
dotted name from `Name.pp`, not the bare identifier — `grep`ping the raw
`.export` file for the identifier only gives you the unqualified form:
```sh
grep -n "pmap_attach" test/parser/init.export   # confirms it exists, wrong form for NYAYA_ONLY_DECL
NYAYA_ONLY_DECL="Vector.pmap_attach" timeout 90 dune exec bin/main.exe  # correct: Namespace.decl
```

**2. Cap virtual memory with `ulimit -v` (KB) in a subshell**, so a runaway
process dies in seconds with `Out_of_memory` instead of slowly eating all
system RAM+swap. The parens make it a subshell so the limit doesn't leak
into your interactive shell. Always redirect both streams to a log file and
keep `timeout` as a second, independent backstop (`ulimit` doesn't help a
process that hangs without allocating):
```sh
(ulimit -v 3000000; NYAYA_ONLY_DECL="Vector.pmap_attach" timeout 60 dune exec bin/main.exe) \
  > /tmp/run.log 2>&1
echo "EXIT:$?"
tail -n 80 /tmp/run.log
```
Try the cap at a couple of different sizes (e.g. 3_000_000 then 10_000_000,
i.e. ~3GB then ~10GB) with the *same* command. If it dies at the same point
in the code regardless of the cap, that's a strong signal it's either (a) a
single catastrophic allocation, or (b) a hang with flat memory (an infinite
or exponential-time loop that never allocates much) — not "genuinely needs
N GB of legitimate working set." That distinction is exactly what separated
bug 1 (real, fast, huge allocation) from bug 2 (a hang, not a leak) below.

**3. Instrument suspects directly in source with cheap global counters +
periodic `Gc.quick_stat()`, flushed unconditionally.** The pattern used
(then removed once the bugs were found — don't leave this in the tree):
```ocaml
let calls = ref 0
...
incr calls;
if !calls mod 5_000 = 0 then (
  let gc = Gc.quick_stat () in
  Printf.eprintf "[DBG %s] calls=%d live_words=%d heap_words=%d\n%!"
    label !calls gc.live_words gc.heap_words
)
```
Two details matter: the `%!` (force-flush every line — under `timeout`/
`ulimit` the process can be killed before a buffered `Format`/`Printf`
channel would otherwise flush, silently losing the last N seconds of
signal) and picking the modulus small enough to actually get a data point
before the crash (started at 200_000, had to drop to 5_000/20_000 once the
first runs printed *nothing* before dying — that itself was informative,
see below). Wire a reset for each new counter into `Tc.typecheck`'s
existing per-declaration reset block (next to `Hashtbl.reset whnf_memo`
etc.) so a `NYAYA_ONLY_DECL` run starts every counter at zero.

**4. Read the *shape* of the counter output to distinguish failure modes,
don't just look at whether it crashed:**
- **Nothing printed before death, even at a low modulus and a high memory
  cap** → not many-small-allocations; look for a single expensive call
  very early (this is how bug 1 — an eager `Expr.pp` inside a trace
  logger — was found: the crash happened between two adjacent counter
  checkpoints that were only a few hundred calls apart).
- **A counter climbs into the billions while `live_words`/`heap_words`
  stay flat** → not a memory problem at all, it's non-termination (a loop
  or exponential recursion that does negligible allocation per step). This
  is how bug 2 was distinguished from "just needs more memory" — before
  the fix, `num_loose_bvars`'s counter passed 9 billion with `live_words`
  unchanged across dozens of printed checkpoints, i.e. actually hung, not
  leaking.

**5. Regression-check any fix on the substitution/typechecking hot path
against a handful of previously-passing declarations**, not just the one
you were debugging — cheap because `NYAYA_ONLY_DECL` gives a fresh,
independent process per name:
```sh
for d in "Int64.toInt32_ofBitVec" "Nat.sub_one" "Fin.castSucc_one" \
         "Fin.zero_le" "String.length_singleton"; do
  echo "=== $d ==="
  timeout 90 env NYAYA_ONLY_DECL="$d" dune exec bin/main.exe 2>&1 | tail -4
done
```
(Names above are just examples pulled from earlier entries in this
changelog — swap in whichever declarations were confirmed passing most
recently.) Note baseline overhead: parsing `init.export` + building the
environment takes ~20s on its own before any checking starts, so size
`timeout` accordingly or a passing declaration will look like a hang.

### Bug 1: `MakeTrace.enter`/`leave_success`/`leave_failure` eagerly computed
debug-only pretty-prints on every call, regardless of log level

**File:** `lib/parser/util.ml`, `MakeTrace.enter`/`leave_success`/`leave_failure`

**Problem:** these three functions called
`Logger.debug "...%s..." ... (Data.input_summary input)` — passing
`Data.input_summary input` (for `InferTrace`/`WhnfTrace`, `expr_summary` =
a full, non-memoized `Expr.pp` tree-walk of the expr) as a plain, positional
function argument. OCaml evaluates function arguments eagerly, so this
pretty-print ran unconditionally on **every single `infer`/`whnf` call**
(enter and leave), even with logging at `Info` level and no debug output
ever shown. `Logs.debug (fun m -> ...)`'s own level check only happens
*inside* the closure passed to it — by the time that closure would run, the
expensive `%s` argument had already been fully computed to build the format
string. `Expr.pp` walks the hash-consed DAG as if it were a tree (no
memoization on `tag`), so on a term with heavy internal sharing this is not
just wasted work but potentially an exponential-length string built in a
single allocation. Confirmed by observing the process die instantly (before
any of several independently-added call counters advanced meaningfully) even
at a 10GB `ulimit -v`.

**Fix:** gate all three call sites behind an explicit
`Logs.level () = Some Logs.Debug` check, so `input_summary`/`output_summary`
are only ever computed when debug output will actually be printed.

**Why this matters beyond this one declaration:** this ran on every
`infer`/`whnf` enter and leave for *every* declaration checked, in every run
configuration (`NYAYA_SWEEP_ALL`, plain discovery, `NYAYA_ONLY_DECL`) — a
low-grade firehose of transient string allocation across the whole corpus.
This is a plausible (not yet confirmed) contributor to the "steady growth, no
single blowup point" OOM signature from the entry below.

### Bug 2: `num_loose_bvars` re-walks the DAG as a tree on every call from `instantiate`

**File:** `lib/expr.ml`, `num_loose_bvars` / `instantiate`

**Problem:** `instantiate_aux` (the beta/let/pi-body substitution engine
used by essentially every case of `infer`/`whnf`/`isDefEq`) calls
`num_loose_bvars expr` at every recursion step, as a short-circuit ("does
this subtree even contain the bound var we're substituting?"). This TODO was
already flagged in the source (`"this needs to be optimized by counting the
number of loose bound variables in the expr"`), but the actual failure mode
wasn't confirmed until now: `num_loose_bvars` itself is a full recursive
tree-walk with **no memoization**, called on a hash-consed DAG with heavy
internal sharing (a well-founded-recursion-generated proof term, in this
case). After fixing bug 1 (which had been OOMing the process before this
code path could even run long enough to matter), `num_loose_bvars` call
counts were observed climbing past **9 billion with zero further progress**
and flat memory (i.e. genuinely non-terminating within a 90s window, not
merely slow) — a DAG-as-tree exponential re-walk, not a memory leak.

**Fix:** memoize `num_loose_bvars` by hash-cons `tag` in a new
`Expr.num_loose_bvars_memo : (int, int) Hashtbl.t`. This is sound
unconditionally (no per-declaration reset needed for correctness): the
function is a pure structural property of the expr node, independent of
`env`/typechecking state/offset, and a given tag's underlying node never
changes. It's reset per declaration anyway (alongside `whnf_memo`/
`infer_memo` in `Tc.typecheck`, all three call sites), purely to bound total
memory across a long sweep, matching the existing convention for those two
tables — not because the cache can go stale.

**Result:** `Vector.pmap_attach` now type-checks successfully in ~60s
(previously: non-terminating / OOM). Verified no regression on 5 known-passing
declarations from earlier entries in this changelog (`Int64.toInt32_ofBitVec`,
`Nat.sub_one`, `Fin.castSucc_one`, `Fin.zero_le`, `String.length_singleton`) —
all still pass.

**Declaration unblocked:** `Vector.pmap_attach` (was OOM/non-terminating, not
a `Defeq_failure`/`TypeError`, so it wouldn't have shown up as a normal
"failing declaration" — it would have just killed whatever process reached
it).

**Next:** ~60s for one declaration (with ~200M `instantiate_aux` calls
remaining, per the advisor's read of the diagnostic data) means `instantiate`
itself is still doing a lot of redundant DAG-as-tree work — a further
optimization is possible (e.g. memoizing `instantiate` keyed on
`(tag, offset)`, not just `tag`, since substitution result depends on
`offset` too) but was deliberately not attempted this session: the reported
problem (OOM/hang) is fixed, and that's a separate, riskier piece of work.
Not yet re-run: the full `NYAYA_SWEEP_ALL` corpus sweep, to see whether these
two fixes (especially bug 1, which fired on every declaration in every mode)
move or remove the ~9000-declaration OOM wall from the entry below. That's
the natural next step for whoever picks up `project_nyaya_oom_investigation`
next.

## 2026-07-09: Discovery blocked by the OOM wall — loop paused, OOM promoted to its own investigation

**Status: loop paused here. This is the handoff point for whoever picks up next.**

After the `isDefEq` same-head shortcut landed (next entry below, `99db72a`),
the standard discovery step — plain `dune exec --root=. nyaya`, no env vars,
which walks the declaration hashtable and is supposed to stop at the first
failure — was run to find the next target. Result: it processed **9478
declarations, all passing, zero failures found**, before being killed with
`EXIT=137` (SIGKILL, i.e. the OS OOM-killer). Re-running it deterministically
re-hits the same wall for zero new information, since the hashtable walk
order is fixed and nothing about the crash depends on which declaration it
happens to land on.

**This is not a new bug.** It's the same open issue in
`project_nyaya_oom_investigation` (Claude's persistent memory) /
this session's earlier finding: a `NYAYA_SWEEP_ALL` full-corpus sweep was
separately OOM-killed after ~69 minutes at ~14.5GB RSS, ~9000+ declarations
in, steady growth, no single blowup point. **The two numbers lining up
(~9000-9500 declarations before SIGKILL, in two totally different run
configurations) is itself informative**: it suggests the crash point is
governed by cumulative memory used per declaration processed within a single
long-running process, not by which specific declaration is being checked or
by which env-var mode is active. Concretely, this means:
- A one-time `NYAYA_SWEEP_ALL` survey (the plan's designated "run this once,
  right before merge, to get full visibility" tool) will almost certainly
  hit the *same* wall around the *same* declaration count, for the same
  reason a second plain-discovery run would — it does not fix or route
  around per-process memory accumulation, it only continues past *caught
  exceptions* (and explicitly does not catch `Out_of_memory`/`Stack_overflow`
  in the first place, per its original design intent).
- Any strategy that keeps processing declarations one after another inside
  a single OCaml process is capped at roughly this same ceiling until the
  actual root cause is found and fixed. Restarting the process between
  declarations (what `NYAYA_ONLY_DECL` does, one fresh process per
  declaration) sidesteps the problem rather than fixing it, and doesn't
  scale to "find me the next failure" when you don't already know its name.

**Ruled out already** (verified by reading the actual code, not assumed —
see `project_nyaya_oom_investigation` memory for the full detail):
- Hash-cons table (`lib/expr.ml`, `HExpr = Hc.Make (E)`) genuinely uses
  `Ephemeron.K1.Make` (confirmed via `~/.opam/5.1.0/lib/hc/hc.ml`) — a real
  weak-key GC-collectible table. The stale TODO comment in `expr.ml` about
  wanting Ephemerons is describing something already done; don't re-blame
  this.
- `MakeTrace.reset` and `whnf_memo`/`infer_memo` are all correctly cleared
  per declaration — not accumulation sources.

**Not yet checked / where to start next:**
- Whether OCaml's major GC is actually keeping pace with a long sustained
  allocation rate (ephemeron clearing only happens during major GC sweeps;
  default `space_overhead` tuning could produce large peak RSS under high
  sustained allocation even with no true "leak"). Try `OCAMLRUNPARAM` GC
  stats during a long run, or test whether periodic `Gc.compact ()` changes
  RSS behavior over ~5000+ declarations.
- Any other module-level cache not yet audited for eviction (e.g. does
  `Level.simplify` or anything in `lib/name.ml` memoize globally without
  ever clearing?).
- Whether per-node representation overhead (boxing, record fields, the
  hash-consed wrapper) is just inherently heavier than the C++ kernel's
  representation, independent of any leak — baseline cost per node, not
  accumulation over time. If so, the fix is a representation change, not a
  GC-tuning fix.
- A profiler run (e.g. `perf`, or OCaml's own `landmarks`/`memtrace`) across
  a multi-thousand-declaration run would likely settle this faster than more
  code reading — this hasn't been tried yet.

**Decision (Kody, 2026-07-09):** the OOM issue is promoted from "open,
revisit later" to "open, dedicated investigation, decoupled from the
correctness loop." It's a bigger, more open-ended engineering problem
(profiling, GC tuning, possibly a representation change) than the
one-declaration-at-a-time citation-gated fixes this loop was scoped for, and
it's now the actual blocker on making further correctness progress via the
discovery mechanism (not just a performance nice-to-have). A new session
should pick this up on its own, separate from the debug-fix loop
infrastructure described in `doc/agentic-loop-retrospective.md`.

**To resume the correctness loop without waiting on the OOM fix:** discovery
doesn't have to be a full-corpus walk. A `NYAYA_ONLY_DECL=<name>` check is
still cheap and memory-bounded for any *specific* candidate name — the
constraint is only that nothing currently provides such a name past
`Int64.toInt32_ofBitVec` (the last one found before the wall). Manually
sampling declaration names from `init.export` (e.g. scanning for names
alphabetically/structurally near recent fixes, or picking from a category
not yet exercised) and trying them one at a time via `NYAYA_ONLY_DECL` would
work without touching the OOM problem, just less systematically than
"run discovery and see what it finds."

## 2026-07-09: Add lazy-delta-reduction "same head" shortcut to isDefEq; unblocks Int64.toInt32_ofBitVec

### isDefEq: compare same-head applications' arguments before delta-unfolding
**File:** `tc.ml`, `isDefEq_impl`
**Problem:** `Int64.toInt32_ofBitVec` (an `rfl`-proved theorem relating
`Int64.toInt32 (Int64.ofBitVec b)` to `Int32.ofBitVec (BitVec.signExtend 64
32 b)`) hit `DEPTH LIMIT: ... input=Nat.sub (BitVec.toNat 64
(Int64.toBitVec (Int64.ofBitVec b))) 18446744073709551117` (a ~2^64
literal). Root cause, found by reading the full debug trace: our
`isDefEq_impl` always calls `whnf` on both sides of a comparison before any
structural check. When both sides of a comparison share a head like
`BitVec.signExtend` (same declaration, applied to different BitVec
arguments on each side), `whnf` unconditionally delta-unfolds that shared
head all the way down into its full computational body (through
`BitVec.ofInt`, `BitVec.ofNatLT`, `Int.toNat`, `HMod.hMod`, eventually
`Nat.sub` on a raw Nat encoding) *before* the two sides' actual differing
argument (`Int64.toBitVec (Int64.ofBitVec b)` vs `b` -- which reduces to
each other in two cheap constructor/projection steps) is ever compared
directly. The expensive, symbolic-minuend Nat.sub this produces is the
thing that exceeded the depth limit; it need never have been computed at
all.
**Fix:** Added `same_head_args_shortcut`, tried after the existing
proof-irrelevance check and before `whnf`: if both sides (pre-whnf) are
applications of the exact same declaration (same `Const` name, same
universe params) with equal arity, compare their arguments pairwise via
`isDefEq` first; if all pairs succeed, the whole application is equal
(sound by congruence: `aᵢ ≡ bᵢ` for all `i` implies `f a⃗ ≡ f b⃗`, so this can
only ever be a true positive, never a false one). If the shortcut doesn't
apply, or any argument pair fails, execution falls through completely
unchanged to the existing whnf-based algorithm -- exactly as if the
shortcut were absent. One subtlety caught during regression testing: our
`isDefEq`'s own final "structural mismatch" fallback does not return
`false` -- it *raises* `Defeq_failure` (via `Logger.err`), uncaught by the
`isDefEq` wrapper. The shortcut's pairwise argument comparison must catch
that exception and treat it as "argument pair failed" (i.e. fall through),
not let it escape and abort the whole outer comparison -- otherwise a
nested mismatch reachable only via the shortcut's *un-reduced* argument
comparison could break declarations that used to pass via the *reduced*
(whnf'd) comparison path. This was caught by regression-testing all 14
previously-unblocked declarations before committing (see Verification
below) -- `Fin.zero_le` and `List.get_cons_succ'` initially regressed with
exactly this failure mode, fixed by wrapping the pairwise check in `try
... with Defeq_failure _ -> false`.
**Kernel reference:** `type_checker.cpp` (leanprover/lean4,
`src/kernel/type_checker.cpp`), fetched via
`raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/lean4/master/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp`
and verified against the raw fetched text directly. The relevant functions:
`is_def_eq_app` (the argument-wise comparison for two applications) and
`lazy_delta_reduction_step`, which gates entry into that argument-wise
comparison specifically for two applications delta-headed by the *same*
declaration with matching universe levels, tried *before* delta-unfolding
that shared declaration:
```cpp
bool type_checker::is_def_eq_app(expr const & t, expr const & s) {
    if (is_app(t) && is_app(s)) {
        buffer<expr> t_args;
        buffer<expr> s_args;
        expr t_fn = get_app_args(t, t_args);
        expr s_fn = get_app_args(s, s_args);
        if (is_def_eq(t_fn, s_fn) && t_args.size() == s_args.size()) {
            unsigned i = 0;
            for (; i < t_args.size(); i++) {
                if (!is_def_eq(t_args[i], s_args[i]))
                    break;
            }
            if (i == t_args.size())
                return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
and, inside `lazy_delta_reduction_step`, the same-declaration/same-height
case:
```cpp
if (is_app(t_n) && is_app(s_n) && is_eqp(*d_t, *d_s) && d_t->get_hints().is_regular()) {
    // Optimization: We try to check if their arguments are definitionally
    // equal. If they are, then t_n and s_n must be definitionally equal,
    // and we can skip the delta-reduction step.
    if (!failed_before(t_n, s_n)) {
        if (is_def_eq(const_levels(get_app_fn(t_n)), const_levels(get_app_fn(s_n))) &&
            is_def_eq_args(t_n, s_n)) {
            return reduction_status::DefEqual;
        } else {
            cache_failure(t_n, s_n);
        }
    }
}
```
Our version does not replicate `d_t->get_hints().is_regular()` (a
performance heuristic restricting the kernel's version to plain,
non-reducible/non-irreducible definitions) or the `failed_before`/
`cache_failure` memoization (a performance optimization, not a correctness
requirement) -- omitting both only means we attempt the shortcut on a
superset of the declarations the kernel would bother trying it on, or
retry a failed comparison instead of caching it, neither of which affects
soundness (the congruence argument holds regardless of which declarations
we try it on, and retrying a failed check just costs time, not
correctness).
**Verification:** Fast-tier (`NYAYA_ONLY_DECL=Int64.toInt32_ofBitVec`)
confirms the target now passes. Additionally ran a full regression pass
(fresh process per declaration) over every declaration listed as
"Declaration unblocked" earlier in this changelog -- `Nat.sub_one`,
`Int.pred_toNat`, `Fin.castSucc_one`, `Fin.zero_le`,
`String.length_singleton`, `Nat.lor.eq_1`, `List.id_run_foldlM`,
`Nat.add_succ_sub_one`, `BitVec.replicate_zero`, `List.get_cons_succ'`,
`ISize.not_xor`, `Vector.findM?_pure`, `BitVec.not_sshiftRight`,
`Float32.toUInt32` -- all still pass after the fix (see the `Defeq_failure`
catch above; the first attempt without that catch regressed `Fin.zero_le`
and `List.get_cons_succ'`, caught and fixed before this commit).
**Declaration unblocked:** `Int64.toInt32_ofBitVec`

## 2026-07-09: Considered and reverted — bounding Nat.sub's literal-subtrahend partial iota to k ≤ 64

**Not committed.** A follow-up to the `Nat.sub` faithful single-step rule
(previous entry, `50af38e`) proposed bounding the concrete-subtrahend case
(`Nat.sub a (NatLit k)` with `a` symbolic) to `k ≤ 64`, mirroring the existing
`Nat.add`/`Nat.mul` literal-successor bounds a few lines below it in
`nat_lit_reduce`, to avoid peeling a huge concrete literal (e.g. a
`2^64`-ish BitVec/UInt mask) one `Nat.pred` at a time.

**Why this is off the SAFE/RISKY axis, not SAFE:** the plan's SAFE label
means "reproduces a documented kernel rule with the kernel's own
preconditions." The real kernel's `Nat.sub` has no such cutoff — it's
`@[extern]`, and with a symbolic minuend and literal subtrahend it iota-
reduces by peeling `succ` with no bound. This proposed change is *narrower*
than the kernel, not a faithful reproduction of an additional kernel
precondition, so it doesn't earn a `Kernel reference:` field. It also can't
be unsound: a bound that only makes whnf get stuck *more* often can never
make two non-defeq terms compare equal — narrowing is soundness-safe by
construction (same reasoning as why the `Nat.add`/`Nat.mul` bounds already
in the file are fine).

**Why reverted anyway:** (1) it doesn't unblock any declaration — no
`debug_*.txt` motivated it, it was proposed speculatively; (2) it is not
verifiable by the fast tier — no currently-failing declaration exercises a
literal subtrahend > 64, so there is no way to confirm the cutoff value or
even that the branch is reachable; (3) the runaway case it targets (huge
literal, symbolic minuend) is already caught by the existing recursion/depth
guard, just with a different failure mode (`Depth_limit` exception vs. a
stuck term) — so the change trades one already-handled failure mode for
another, for zero net gain; (4) `k ≤ 64` lands squarely in BitVec/UInt mask
territory, i.e. exactly the range where getting the cutoff wrong would be
most likely to matter, with no test to catch a wrong choice. Verdict: revert
until a real failing declaration actually hits this path, then add the bound
with a concrete case to verify against.

## 2026-07-08: Fix unsound Nat.sub partial iota; unblocks Nat.sub_one

### Nat.sub: replace paired-decrement shortcut with faithful single-step rule
**File:** `tc.ml`, `nat_lit_reduce`
**Problem:** `Nat.sub_one` (`n - 1 = Nat.pred n`, proved by `rfl`) failed with a
structural mismatch bottoming out at `Nat.sub n##83 =?= Nat.rec ...` (comparing
`Nat.sub`'s and `Nat.pred`'s delta-unfolded recursor forms directly, rather
than reducing `Nat.sub n##83 1` down to `Nat.pred n##83` first). Investigating
this surfaced a deeper, pre-existing problem: the *existing* partial-iota
rules for `Nat.sub` — `Nat.sub 0 _ → 0` and `Nat.sub (succ n) (succ m) →
Nat.sub n m` (added 2026-03-26, before this session's citation discipline) —
do not match the real kernel's single-step reduction and are only
*propositionally* true (provable by induction on the second argument), not
*definitionally* true by iota alone, when that argument is symbolic. E.g. the
real `Nat.sub 0 (succ b)` iota-reduces to `Nat.pred (Nat.sub 0 b)`, which is
*stuck* when `b` is a free variable — not the literal `0` the old rule
claimed. This is the same class of over-generalization flagged in
`doc/soundness-risks.md` entry #1: a rule that's true for the cases it was
built to unblock, generalized further than the cited definition supports.
**Fix:** Replaced both special cases with a single rule that mirrors the real
definition's one-step reduction exactly: `Nat.sub a 0 → a` (unchanged, this
one *is* the literal first match arm) and `Nat.sub a (succ b) → Nat.pred
(Nat.sub a b)` — recursing only on the second argument, leaving the first
argument `a` untouched and possibly fully symbolic, then wrapping in
`Nat.pred` (not a kernel builtin, so it delta-unfolds and iota-reduces
normally once its own argument becomes constructor-headed). This is what
directly resolves `Nat.sub_one`: `Nat.sub n 1 → Nat.pred (Nat.sub n 0) →
Nat.pred n` via the existing `Nat.sub a 0 → a` case plus this new one,
landing on exactly the theorem's RHS.
**Kernel reference:** `Nat.sub`, `src/Init/Prelude.lean` (leanprover/lean4),
fetched via `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/leanprover/lean4@master/...` (raw GitHub
mirror), verified against the raw fetched text directly:
```
@[extern "lean_nat_sub", instance_reducible]
protected def Nat.sub : (@& Nat) → (@& Nat) → Nat
  | a, 0      => a
  | a, succ b => pred (Nat.sub a b)
```
Pattern matching is on the *second* argument only; the first argument is
never inspected by the definition, so no rule may require it to be
succ-decomposable, and no rule may claim a result without wrapping in
`Nat.pred` per recursive step.
**Regression note:** the removed `Nat.sub (succ n) (succ m) → Nat.sub n m`
case previously unblocked `Int.pred_toNat` (2026-03-26 entry). Re-verified
`Int.pred_toNat` still passes with the corrected rule (fast-tier,
`NYAYA_ONLY_DECL=Int.pred_toNat`) — its use case only ever had a concrete
literal in the relevant position, so the faithful step-by-step reduction
(via repeated `Nat.pred` wrapping) still reaches the same normal form.
**Declaration unblocked:** `Nat.sub_one` (and corrects `Int.pred_toNat`'s
previous reliance on an unsound shortcut).

## 2026-07-08: Fix Nat.mod divisor-0 convention (mod n 0 = n, not 0)

### Nat.mod n 0 correctness fix
**File:** `tc.ml`, `nat_lit_reduce`
**Problem:** Both the fully-concrete `binary` case and the symbolic partial-iota
case for `Nat.mod` reduced `Nat.mod n 0` to `0`. This is wrong: Lean's `Nat.mod`
returns the dividend, not `0`, when the divisor is `0`. This was a pre-existing
bug (not introduced in this pass) that made `nyaya` treat `n % 0` and `0` as
definitionally equal when they are not (for nonzero `n`), which is a real
unsoundness — an overly permissive rule that could let a false equation type-
check via `rfl`. It was found opportunistically while citing the real `Nat.mod`
definition for the `Fin.castSucc_one` fix above.
**Fix:** Changed both reduction sites: the divisor-0 branch of the concrete
`binary` computation now returns the numerator `m` instead of `Expr.natlit
Z.zero`, and the `is_zero b` partial-iota case now returns `whnf env a` (the
numerator) instead of `Expr.natlit Z.zero`.
**Kernel reference:** `Nat.mod`, `src/Init/Prelude.lean` (leanprover/lean4),
fetched via `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/leanprover/lean4@master/...` (a GitHub raw
mirror) after `raw.githubusercontent.com` and the `github.com` blob view were
both rate-limited (429) during this session; verified against the raw fetched
text directly (not a paraphrase). Doc comment on `Nat.mod`, quoted verbatim
from the fetched source:
> The modulo operator, which computes the remainder when dividing one natural
> number by another. Usually accessed via the `%` operator. When the divisor
> is `0`, the result is the dividend rather than an error.
>
> Examples:
>  * `7 % 2 = 1`
>  * `9 % 3 = 0`
>  * `5 % 7 = 5`
>  * `5 % 0 = 5`
>  * `show ∀ (n : Nat), 0 % n = 0 from fun _ => rfl`
>  * `show ∀ (m : Nat), 5 % (m + 6) = 5 from fun _ => rfl`

And the actual definition:
```
protected def Nat.mod : @& Nat → @& Nat → Nat
  | 0, _ => 0
  | n@(succ _), m => ite (LE.le m n) (Nat.modCore n m) n
```
For `m = 0`: `LE.le 0 n` is always true, so this takes the `Nat.modCore n 0`
branch. `Nat.modCore n 0`'s definition (`dite (LT.lt 0 y) (fun hy => ...) (fun
_ => x)` with `y = 0`) takes the `x`-branch since `0 < 0` is false, returning
`x = n` (the dividend) unchanged. So `Nat.mod n 0 = n`, confirming the
docstring's `5 % 0 = 5` example.
**Declaration unblocked:** none directly (no currently-failing `init.export`
declaration in this pass exercised this path); this is a correctness fix for
an already-committed rule, verified not to regress any previously-passing
declaration (see verification below).
**Verification:** fast-tier (`Fin.castSucc_one` still passes) plus full
regression tier — all 12 previously-unblocked declarations (`Fin.zero_le`,
`String.length_singleton`, `Nat.lor.eq_1`, `List.id_run_foldlM`,
`Nat.add_succ_sub_one`, `BitVec.replicate_zero`, `List.get_cons_succ'`,
`ISize.not_xor`, `Vector.findM?_pure`, `BitVec.not_sshiftRight`,
`Int.pred_toNat`, `Float32.toUInt32`) still pass individually.

## 2026-07-08: Nat.mod partial iota for concrete positive numerator

### Nat.mod literal-numerator, symbolic-denominator partial iota
**File:** `tc.ml`, `nat_lit_reduce`
**Problem:** `Fin.castSucc_one` (proved by `rfl`) failed with a structural mismatch
bottoming out at `Nat.add n##8 0 =?= Nat.add n##8 1`, traced back through
`Fin.val`/`Fin.mk`/`Fin.castSucc` to `Nat.mod 1 (n##8+2) =?= Nat.mod 1 (n##8+3)`
(via `Fin.instOfNat`'s use of `Nat.mod` to compute `OfNat.ofNat (Fin _) 1`). Both
sides needed to reduce to the literal `1`, but `nat_lit_reduce`'s `Nat.mod` case
only handled the fully-concrete case and the two "one side is literal 0" partial
cases — not "numerator is a positive literal, denominator symbolic."
**Fix:** Added a partial iota rule: when the numerator `a` is a concrete positive
`NatLit k` and `Nat.ble b a` (using the existing `Nat.ble` partial-iota chain)
reduces to `Bool.false` (i.e. denominator `b > a`), return `k`. This mirrors the
real `Nat.mod` definition's `ite (LE.le m n) (Nat.modCore n m) n` branch taking
the `n` arm when the `LE.le` condition is false.
**Kernel reference:** `Nat.mod`, `src/Init/Prelude.lean` (leanprover/lean4):
```
protected def Nat.mod : Nat → Nat → Nat
  | 0, _ => 0
  | n@(succ _), m => ite (LE.le m n) (Nat.modCore n m) n
```
Doc comment on `Nat.mod`: "`Nat.mod n (m + n + 1)` should reduce to `n` for
concrete `Nat` literals `n` ... These reductions help `Fin n` literals work
well, because the `OfNat` instance for `Fin` uses `Nat.mod`." Our case
(`Nat.mod 1 (n##8+2)`) is exactly this pattern with literal `n = 1`, `m = n##8`.
**Declaration unblocked:** `Fin.castSucc_one`

## 2026-04-13: Nat.mod/Nat.div partial iota for zero first argument

### Nat.mod 0 n and Nat.div 0 n partial iota rules
**File:** `tc.ml`, `nat_lit_reduce`
**Problem:** `Fin.zero_le` failed with a structural mismatch:
`OfNat.ofNat Nat 0 (instOfNatNat 0)` vs `Fin.val n (OfNat.ofNat (Fin n) 0 (Fin.instOfNat n _ 0))`.
The RHS reduces through `Fin.instOfNat` → `Fin.ofNat` → `Fin.mk n (HMod.hMod ... 0 n) ...`,
then proj-reduce fires on `Fin.val` to extract the first field, leaving `Nat.mod 0 n`.
The LHS reduces to the Nat literal `0`. The mismatch was `0 =?= Nat.mod 0 n` — the
latter was stuck because `nat_lit_reduce` for `Nat.mod` only had the `binary` case
(both args must be NatLit). With symbolic `n`, no reduction fired.
**Fix:** Add partial iota rules to `Nat.mod` and `Nat.div` for when one arg is zero:
- `Nat.mod 0 n → 0`
- `Nat.mod n 0 → 0` (Lean kernel convention)
- `Nat.div 0 n → 0`
- `Nat.div n 0 → 0` (Lean kernel convention)
**Declaration unblocked:** `Fin.zero_le`

## 2026-04-13: String literal projection reduction (2637 declarations checked)

### Proj-reduce string literals by expanding to constructor form
**File:** `tc.ml`, `whnf_impl` Proj case
**Problem:** `String.length_singleton` (proved by `rfl`) requires
`String.length (String.singleton c) =?= 1` definitionally. The reduction chain
expands via `String.push` → `String.casesOn` (struct-eta) → `String.mk (List.append "".data [c])`.
The key step: `String.casesOn` struct-eta generates the projection `"".String.0`
(i.e. `Expr.proj "String" 0 ""`) to extract the `data` field of the empty string
literal `""`. `whnf` reduces this by delegating to the `Proj` case, but the existing
code only handles `Expr.Const`-headed inner terms (constructor applications). A string
literal `Expr.Literal (Expr.StrLit "")` isn't constructor-headed, so proj-reduce
silently gave up and returned `"".String.0` unchanged. This blocked `List.rec` from
firing iota on `List.append [] [c]`, leaving `List.length` stuck at a non-literal.
**Fix:** After `whnf env inner` in the `Expr.Proj` branch, expand any `StrLit s`
to its constructor form via `Reduce.string_lit_to_ctor s` before attempting
proj-reduce. For `""`, this yields `String.mk (List.nil Char)`, whose head
`String.mk` is a constructor, so proj-reduce fires and extracts `List.nil Char`.
The rest of the reduction chain (`List.append [] [c] → [c]`, `List.length [c] → 1`)
then completes normally.
**Declaration unblocked:** `String.length_singleton`

## 2026-03-28: Structure eta, lambda eta, Nat symbolic successor iota, bitwise delta

### Narrow Nat builtin delta guard to primitives only
**File:** `tc.ml`, `is_nat_builtin_name`
**Problem:** `Nat.lor.eq_1` failed because `Nat.lor` was in the builtin guard list,
blocking delta-unfolding when `nat_lit_reduce` didn't fire (symbolic args). The
equation lemma needs `Nat.lor` to unfold to `Nat.bitwise Bool.or` to verify
definitional equality.
**Fix:** Remove bitwise operations (`Nat.land`, `Nat.lor`, `Nat.xor`,
`Nat.shiftLeft`, `Nat.shiftRight`, `Nat.testBit`) from `is_nat_builtin_name`. They
still get the O(1) fast path from `nat_lit_reduce` on concrete args, but now fall
through to delta when the fast path doesn't apply. Safe because `Nat.bitwise`
recurses logarithmically (divides by 2), unlike primitive arithmetic (linear).
**Declaration unblocked:** `Nat.lor.eq_1`

### Lambda eta in isDefEq
**File:** `tc.ml`, `isDefEq_impl`
**Problem:** `List.id_run_foldlM` compared `fun x y => Pure.pure Id ... (f x y)`
against `f`. The outermost `Lam` is already WHNF so the `Pure.pure` inside the body
never gets a chance to reduce, and the `Lam` vs `FreeVar` pair has no matching case.
**Fix:** Add lambda eta to the catch-all in `isDefEq_impl`: when one side is a `Lam`
and the other is not, instantiate the lambda body with a fresh variable and apply the
other side to the same variable, then recurse. This lets the `Pure.pure Id` in the
body reach WHNF and reduce away.
**Declaration unblocked:** `List.id_run_foldlM`

### Nat.add/Nat.mul symbolic successor partial iota
**File:** `tc.ml`, `nat_lit_reduce`
**Problem:** `Nat.add_succ_sub_one` (`m + succ n - 1 = m + n`) failed because
`Nat.add m (Nat.succ n)` was stuck — the partial iota rules only fired when the
second argument was a concrete `NatLit`, not a symbolic `Nat.succ y`. This blocked
`Nat.sub` from seeing the successor in the result, so the whole expression stayed
unreduced.
**Fix:** Extend partial iota for `Nat.add` and `Nat.mul` to handle symbolic
successor arguments after the `NatLit` check fails:
`Nat.add x (Nat.succ y) → Nat.succ (Nat.add x y)`,
`Nat.mul x (Nat.succ y) → Nat.add (Nat.mul x y) x`.
**Declaration unblocked:** `Nat.add_succ_sub_one`

### Nat.mul partial iota rules
**File:** `tc.ml`, `nat_lit_reduce`
**Problem:** `BitVec.replicate_zero` failed with a structural mismatch:
`HMul.hMul Nat Nat Nat (instHMul Nat instMulNat) w (OfNat.ofNat Nat 0 ...)` vs
`OfNat.ofNat Nat 0 ...`. After type class unfolding this is `Nat.mul w 0 =?= 0`,
but `Nat.mul` only had concrete binary reduction (both args literal) and no partial
iota rules for symbolic arguments.
**Fix:** Add partial iota rules for `Nat.mul` (bounded to second arg ≤ 64):
`Nat.mul x 0 → 0`, `Nat.mul x (n+1) → Nat.add (Nat.mul x n) x`.
**Declaration unblocked:** `BitVec.replicate_zero`

### Structure eta in isDefEq
**File:** `tc.ml`, `isDefEq_impl`
**Problem:** `List.get_cons_succ'` still failed after iota structure eta because the
final defeq check compared `Fin.mk n (Nat.add i.0 0) proof` (constructor application)
against `i` (a free variable). The `isDefEq` match had no case for comparing a
constructor-headed term against a non-constructor term and fell through to
"structural mismatch".
**Fix:** Before the catch-all error in `isDefEq_impl`, try structure eta: when one
side is a constructor application of a structure type (single ctor, no indices, not
recursive), compare each constructor field against the corresponding projection of
the other side. For `Fin.mk n val proof` vs `i`, this compares `val =?= i.0`
(succeeds via `Nat.add x 0 → x`) and `proof =?= i.1` (succeeds via proof
irrelevance).
**Declaration unblocked:** `List.get_cons_succ'`

---

## 2026-03-27: Proof-irrelevant App inference & structure eta for iota

### Skip defeq check for Prop-typed arguments in infer App
**File:** `tc.ml`, `infer` App case
**Problem:** Inferring the type of applications whose arguments are proofs (Prop-typed)
triggered expensive defeq checks on auto-generated proof terms (omega, decide, etc.).
These terms can be enormous and normalising them is wasteful since proof irrelevance
means the exact proof doesn't matter.
**Fix:** Before checking `isDefEq btype arg_type`, check whether `btype` is a Prop
(its type whnf's to `Sort 0`). If so, skip the defeq check entirely — any two proofs
of the same Prop are interchangeable.

### Structure eta in iota reduction
**File:** `tc.ml`, `iota_at_head`
**Problem:** `List.get_cons_succ'` (proved by `rfl`) requires
`List.get (a :: as) (Fin.succ i) =?= List.get as i` to hold definitionally. After
reducing through `brecOn`/`List.rec`/`List.get.match_1`, the kernel reaches
`Fin.casesOn` applied to `Fin.succ _ i`. `Fin.succ` unfolds into a match on `i`, but
`i` is a free variable, so the inner `Fin.casesOn` gets stuck. The whole LHS is stuck
at `Fin.rec ... (Fin.rec ... i ...)` and can't match the RHS.
**Fix:** When `iota_at_head` encounters a non-constructor major premise for a
structure-like recursor (single constructor, no indices, not recursive), apply
"structure eta": reduce by projecting out each field from the major premise.
`S.rec params motive minor x → minor (x.0) (x.1) …`
This is the same rule Lean 4's kernel uses for structure recursors.
**Declaration unblocked:** `List.get_cons_succ'`

---

## 2026-03-26: Nat bitwise builtins & early proof irrelevance

### Nat bitwise builtins
**File:** `tc.ml`, `nat_lit_reduce` and `is_nat_builtin_name`
**Problem:** `ISize.not_xor` reduces through ISize → USize → BitVec → Nat, landing on
`Nat.xor` (defined as `Nat.bitwise bne`). Without a kernel builtin, `Nat.xor` was
delta-unfolded to `Nat.bitwise._unary` → `WellFounded.fix` → `Nat.recAux` on 2^64−2.
**Fix:** Added 6 new Nat builtins with O(1) concrete reduction via Zarith:
- `Nat.land` → `Z.logand`
- `Nat.lor` → `Z.logor`
- `Nat.xor` → `Z.logxor`
- `Nat.shiftLeft` → `Z.shift_left`
- `Nat.shiftRight` → `Z.shift_right`
- `Nat.testBit` → `Z.testbit` (returns Bool)

All registered in `is_nat_builtin_name` to block delta-unfolding on symbolic args.
Also fixed latent bug: `Nat.pow` was missing from `is_nat_builtin_name`.

### Early proof irrelevance in isDefEq
**File:** `tc.ml`, `isDefEq_impl`
**Problem:** `isDefEq` whnf'd both sides BEFORE checking proof irrelevance. When
comparing `BitVec.xor._proof_1` proof terms with different arguments, whnf unfolded
`Nat.bitwise_lt_two_pow` → `Nat.rec` on 64 (the bit-width), producing a 512KB trace.
The proof irrelevance check would have short-circuited this, but it ran too late.
**Fix:** Moved proof irrelevance check before whnf. `infer` is memoised so the type
check is cheap, and proofs of the same Prop are immediately equal without reduction.
**Declaration unblocked:** `ISize.not_xor`

---

## 2026-03-26: Projection reduction and Nat partial iota (57+ declarations passing)

### Projection reduction guard
**File:** `tc.ml`, `whnf_impl` Proj case
**Problem:** The Proj case in whnf matched ANY `Expr.Const` head, including stuck
recursors (`List.rec`, `Nat.rec`). This extracted arbitrary recursor arguments as
if they were constructor fields, producing garbage results.
**Fix:** Added `List.mem cname ctor_names` guard to verify the head is actually a
constructor of the projected inductive type before extracting fields.
**Declaration unblocked:** `Vector.findM?_pure`

### Nat.zero normalization
**File:** `tc.ml`, `whnf_impl` Const case
**Problem:** `Nat.zero` (a `Const` node) and `NatLit 0` (a `Literal` node) are
definitionally equal in Lean but are different AST nodes. `isDefEq` had no
Const-vs-Literal case, so `Nat.zero =?= NatLit 0` failed.
**Fix:** whnf normalizes `Const "Nat.zero"` to `NatLit 0`.
**Declaration unblocked:** `BitVec.not_sshiftRight`

### Partial iota for Nat.add
**File:** `tc.ml`, `nat_lit_reduce`
**Problem:** `Nat.add x 1` should reduce to `Nat.succ x`, but the `is_nat_builtin`
guard blocked delta-unfolding, and `nat_lit_reduce` only handled fully-concrete args.
**Fix:** Added partial iota rules in `nat_lit_reduce`:
- `Nat.add x 0 → x`
- `Nat.add x (n+1) → Nat.succ (Nat.add x n)` (bounded: n <= 64)

**Declaration unblocked:** `Vector.findM?_pure` (after projection fix)

### Partial iota for Nat.beq
**File:** `tc.ml`, `nat_lit_reduce`
**Problem:** `Nat.beq (Nat.succ n) (Nat.succ m)` should reduce to `Nat.beq n m`
but was stuck because the builtin guard blocked delta-unfolding.
**Fix:** Added partial iota rules:
- `Nat.beq (succ n) (succ m) → Nat.beq n m`
- `Nat.beq (succ _) 0 → Bool.false`
- `Nat.beq 0 (succ _) → Bool.false`

**Declaration unblocked:** `BitVec.not_sshiftRight`

### Partial iota for Nat.sub
**File:** `tc.ml`, `nat_lit_reduce`
**Problem:** `Nat.sub (Nat.succ m) 1` should reduce to `m`. Same builtin guard issue.
**Fix:** Added partial iota rules (handles both `Nat.succ x` and `NatLit (k+1)`
as successor forms):
- `Nat.sub x 0 → x`
- `Nat.sub 0 _ → 0`
- `Nat.sub (succ n) (succ m) → Nat.sub n m`

**Declaration unblocked:** `Int.pred_toNat`

### Partial iota for Nat.ble
**File:** `tc.ml`, `nat_lit_reduce`
**Problem:** Same pattern as Nat.beq — symbolic args blocked by builtin guard.
**Fix:** Added partial iota rules:
- `Nat.ble 0 _ → Bool.true`
- `Nat.ble (succ _) 0 → Bool.false`
- `Nat.ble (succ n) (succ m) → Nat.ble n m`

**Declaration unblocked:** Proactive (anticipated from BitVec/UInt comparisons)

### Opaque declaration support
**Files:** `tc.ml` (check function), `decl.ml` (get_value)
**Problem:** `Opaque` declarations fell through to the error case in `check`.
**Fix:** Added `Opaque` case to `check` that infers the value's type and checks it
against the declared type (same as `Def`/`Thm`). Opaques remain unfoldable via
`get_value` (matching upstream behavior of exporting opaques as defs).
**Declaration unblocked:** `Float32.toUInt32`

### Nat.pow removed from kernel builtin list
**File:** `tc.ml`, `is_nat_builtin_name`
**Problem:** `Nat.pow` was listed as a kernel builtin, but it's NOT one in the Lean 4
kernel (only `succ`, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `mod`, `beq`, `ble` are). This
blocked delta-unfolding of `Nat.pow` on symbolic args, causing `isDefEq` to compare
the stuck `Nat.pow m n` against `Nat.mul n m` and fail.
**Fix:** Removed `Nat.pow` from `is_nat_builtin_name`.
**Note:** Later re-added `Nat.pow` to `is_nat_builtin_name` alongside the bitwise
builtins — it IS needed once the bitwise ops are present.

## Architecture notes

### Nat builtin strategy
The Lean 4 C++ kernel computes Nat builtins natively in O(1). Our OCaml kernel
replicates this with two mechanisms:
1. **`nat_lit_reduce`**: O(1) computation when all args are concrete `NatLit` values
2. **`is_nat_builtin` guard**: Prevents delta-unfolding builtins on symbolic args
   (which would expose O(n) `Nat.brecOn` recursion on huge literals)
3. **Partial iota rules**: For cases where one arg is symbolic but the other is a
   small concrete value or a constructor (`succ`), apply the iota rules directly
   with bounded recursion

### Known remaining work
- Optimization: some declarations run unacceptably slow
- Constructor checks are stubbed out (`check_ctor` always returns true)
- Recursor and Inductive checks are stubbed out
- ~~Missing Nat bitwise builtins~~ (done: `Nat.land`, `Nat.lor`, `Nat.xor`, `Nat.shiftLeft`, `Nat.shiftRight`, `Nat.testBit`)
- Quotient type checking
- Full test suite: 57 of 36688 declarations passing
